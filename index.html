  <p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological and social well-being. It affects the way we think, feel and act when we face life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make decisions. Mental health is important at all stages of life, from childhood and adolescence to adulthood and old age.
  </p>
  <p>When it comes to your emotions, it can be hard to know what's normal and what's not. But mental health problems have warning signs, such as:

    Changes in your eating or sleeping habits
    Isolating yourself from the people and activities you enjoy
    Have little or no energy
    Feeling empty or like nothing matters
    Have unexplained aches and pains
    Feeling helpless or hopeless
    Smoking, drinking, or using drugs more than usual
    Feeling unusually confused, forgetful, angry, upset, worried, or scared
    Have severe mood swings that cause problems in their relationships
    Having thoughts and memories that you can't get out of your head
    Hearing voices or believing things that are not true
    Thinking about hurting yourself or others
    Not being able to do daily tasks like taking care of your children or going to work or school
    .</p>
    <p>If you think you may have a mental health problem, seek help. Talk therapy and/or medications can treat mental disorders. If you don't know where to start, talk to your health care professional.
